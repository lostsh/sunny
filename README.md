# Physical part
The phisical part is composed of several parts too :

##### Arduino, **[code right hire](https://github.com/lostsh/Solar-Tracker-Sunny)** who control the position of the pannel with servo motors (or stepper motors idk the solution we chose actually the work is in progress)

##### Micro computer card who can :
- hosts the main page of the website to display informations
- only send data on the website hosted on a server
- recive requests for test, debug or make some change on the params of the Tracker
- send aletrs in case of unusual things

##### Structure in cardboard to be lighter because the servomotors are only 9g ... (so painful) :cry:
