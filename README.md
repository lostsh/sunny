# Solar Tracker
#### A solar panel who follow the sun

*sunny is the name of the sensor composed of four photoresistors*

# Project
This project is composed of sevral parts ;
- the website you can find the [code here](https://github.com/lostsh/sunny).
- the phisical system

# Website
On the website you will acces to the data frome the pannel
- state
- voltage received
- position
- statistics
- and more ...

# Physical part
The phisical part is composed of several parts too :

##### Arduino, **[code right hire](https://github.com/lostsh/Solar-Tracker-Sunny)** who control the position of the pannel with servo motors (or stepper motors idk the solution we chose actually the work is in progress)

##### Micro computer card who can :
- hosts the main page of the website to display informations
- only send data on the website hosted on a server
- recive requests for test, debug or make some change on the params of the Tracker
- send aletrs in case of unusual things

##### Structure in cardboard to be lighter because the servomotors are only 9g ... (so painful)

# Things to do :
- [ ] Change horloge font
- [ ] Finish “expériences”
- [ ] - Déscribe all the méthodes
- [ ] - Put img of the building of the system
- [ ] Finish “comparaison”
- [ ] - Array to compare values of the first and the second methodes
- [ ] Finish “synthèse” => conclusion.html
- [ ] - Que nous a apporté ce projet ?
- [ ] - mettre nos synthèse perso (??)

- [ ] Finir la construction du tracker
- [ ] *Comments the code*

- [ ] Finir les synthèse personnelles ! (à imprimer ?? -> à demander)
- [ ] **Faut-il faire en plus un diapo pour l’oral ? (à demander)**
